Teleop Control
==============

Use this code (especially `teleop.py` and the associated calibration code) to see your robot moving. It relies on code from the `motion` and `controller` nodes.

`d` for forward
`s` for backward
`w` for right
`a` for left
`x` for cw
`z` for ccw
`any other key` for stop
`shift+c` for calibrate
`h` for homing the robot
`shift+h` for go to home
`shift+b` for battery
`shift+g` for go to point
`spacebar` for stop and quit
